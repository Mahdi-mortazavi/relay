# Changelog

Notable changes to Relay. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
Relay is pre-1.0, so minor versions may still change behaviour.

Releases are cut per platform (`android-vX.Y.Z`, `windows-vX.Y.Z`) — see
[`docs/release.md`](docs/release.md). Artifacts for every version are on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/Mahdi-mortazavi/relay/releases).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A device lab that GitHub provisions itself** (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`).
  Every pull request now runs the real APK on a real Android emulator (API 30
  and 34), drives the golden journey through the real UI, and relays real HTTP
  traffic through the real SOCKS5 server. A third job runs the Windows client's
  own code against a *live phone* over `adb`, so the two platforms' shipping
  implementations are tested against each other rather than against a fixture. A
  fourth installs, launches and uninstalls the real Windows installer, checking
  the system proxy registry after every stage. Screenshots, the issued pairing
  payload and `logcat` are uploaded from every run.
- `Socks5ServerTest`: 18 protocol-level tests against the real SOCKS5 server
  over real loopback sockets, running on every PR.
- `SECURITY.md`, including an honest threat model for the unauthenticated
  proxy on a shared network.
- Static analysis and dependency review on every PR
  (`.github/workflows/security.yml`), plus Dependabot.
- Issue and pull-request templates.

### Fixed

- **"Stop sharing" did not stop the traffic.** Closing the listening socket and
  cancelling the coroutine scope cannot interrupt a blocking read; only closing
  the socket can. The notification and wake lock went away while the laptop kept
  browsing through the phone.
- **The phone fell back to "waiting for a device" mid-download.** A connection
  that aborted during the handshake, or whose CONNECT failed, decremented the
  per-IP client counter it had never incremented — and a browser produces those
  routinely from the same IP as its live tunnel. The transfer wake lock was
  released with the tunnel still open.
- **Full Mode was selectable but could never start**, so choosing it always
  ended in "Couldn't start Full Mode". It is now shown as not available in this
  build, and a Full setting saved by an earlier version falls back to Fast.
- **The pairing card re-faded and the QR was re-encoded once a second** for the
  whole session, because the state crossfade was keyed on a value carrying live
  byte counters. QR encoding also moved off the main thread.
- **An undismissible notification after any error.** Error paths set the state
  and returned without stopping the foreground service, so the ongoing
  notification survived dismissing the error in the app.
- **UI freeze and ANR risk when starting.** Interface enumeration and up to four
  socket binds ran on the main thread.
- **Content drawn under the system bars** — edge-to-edge was enabled with no
  insets handling.
- **Windows: a lost connection could silently strand the system proxy.** If the
  rollback threw after the reconnect budget was exhausted, the exception
  vanished as an unobserved task fault: the proxy stayed applied, the phone was
  gone, and the UI still said "Connected".
- **Windows: signing out or shutting down while connected left a dead proxy**
  with nothing to undo it. Relay now registers a one-shot recovery entry for
  exactly as long as a session is applied, so the next sign-in repairs it.
- **Windows: uninstalling could delete the proxy backup after failing to restore
  it**, turning a recoverable problem into a permanently broken machine. The
  backup now survives uninstall; only the disposable log is removed.
- **Windows: quitting from the tray after a failed rollback exited silently**,
  leaving the proxy applied and no app to fix it.
- **Windows: a crash-recovery failure at startup could brick every launch**, and
  a flaky VPN or virtual adapter could crash the app on Connect.
- **Windows: the camera preview could crash the app mid-scan** and leaked an
  unmanaged bitmap per dropped frame.
- A leaked file descriptor per failed port bind on Android.

### Changed

- Mode segments are proper radio controls with 48 dp targets.
- `docs/testing.md` describes the automated lab, and states what it cannot
  reach — physical camera scanning, WinUI control automation, Windows sleep — as
  **BLOCKED — infrastructure** rather than omitting it.
